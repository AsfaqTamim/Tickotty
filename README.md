## Features

### Dashboard
You can track weekly statistics of open, assigned, answered, or closed tickets and the resolving percentages from the dashboard.
### Clients
To create tickets, clients must register. All registered users are added directly to the "client" list if you have problems with a specific client, you can prevent them from logging into the application.
### Tickets 
Registered clients can easily add and follow on their support requests, agents who review support requests can filter requests by status, priority, assigned staff, or department.
### Reports 
This feature supplies information about the statistics of the average response and resolution times of all tickets, as well as taking reports about tickets filtered by assigned staff or other characteristics.
### Service Level Policy 
You & your client can agree on a mutual time about how much time period the requests will be answered or resolved. When you define & assign this parameter to your client, you can see the details of SLA in the support tickets, this data is constantly checked with the cron jobs and a notification is sent for the violated support tickets.
### Staff 
You or your clients can add staff or workfellows to the application. You can also authorize a staff member and restrict any user from accessing the features. Staff can change their working hours.
### Knowledge Base 
Thanks to the knowledge base, your clients can find the answers they seek without the need to create a support request. You can add new articles to the knowledge base for clients who want to reach the solution quickly.
### Custom Fields 
You can use custom fields to get additional information from customers who submit a ticket. These fields can be managed and rearranged by you. Also, they can be created conditionally if their definition depends on other fields.
